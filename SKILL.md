# Ironic Voice

A skill for adopting the voice of what you oppose with such fidelity that the voice condemns itself.

## When to Use

- When direct criticism has been dismissed or ignored
- When the target's own language reveals more than external critique could
- When you want readers to recognize positions they hold or tolerate
- When the gap between stated values and actual behavior is the message

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Study the Original

Know the voice better than its speakers do:
- Read extensively in the target's actual words
- Note vocabulary, sentence patterns, rhetorical moves
- Identify what they never say directly
- Find the tensions and contradictions they paper over

You must be able to produce text that could genuinely be theirs.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Find the Self-Indictment

Locate what the voice reveals when speaking freely:
- Assumptions stated as facts
- Concerns that reveal priorities
- Euphemisms that name cruelty
- Logic that leads to monstrous conclusions

The self-indictment must be genuinely present in the original position, not invented.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Adopt Completely

Write as the voice without any external commentary:
- No ironic winking or eyebrow-raising
- No exaggeration beyond what the real voice does
- Maintain complete internal consistency
- Sound more like them than they do

The reader should be uncertain whether this is real or satire - that uncertainty is the point.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Let Them Hang Themselves

Provide the rope but don't tie the noose:
- Let the logic proceed to its natural conclusion
- Allow the implications to emerge without pointing
- Use their vocabulary for what it actually describes
- Trust readers to see what you see

The ironic voice creates the conditions for recognition, not the recognition itself.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Maintain to the End

Never break:
- No final reveal or "gotcha"
- No signal that this is satire
- End where the voice would end
- Leave readers with only the text

## Output Format

An ironic voice piece including:
1. Identification of target voice and its self-condemnation
2. The text in that voice, complete and unbroken
3. Notes on what makes it recognizably the target (for your reference)
4. Anticipated reader responses and recognitions

## Constraints

- The voice must be accurate - errors break the spell
- Don't exaggerate beyond what the real voice does
- Target positions of power, not marginalized people
- Be prepared for readers who don't get it
- The self-indictment must be genuinely theirs, not your projection

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Write in the voice of tech executives discussing worker productivity monitoring

**Output**:
"We've found that comprehensive workspace analytics actually empower our team members. By tracking keyboard activity, mouse movements, and screen time in real-time, we can identify opportunities for optimization. Our workers appreciate knowing exactly how productive they've been - it removes ambiguity from performance conversations. Some have expressed concerns about 'surveillance,' but these tend to come from underperformers who benefit from opacity. High performers welcome transparency. We're also piloting biometric mood sensing, which will allow us to proactively support team members before they even know they're struggling. It's really about care at scale. The productivity gains speak for themselves: we've achieved 12% more output with 8% fewer workers, and turnover is up only slightly..."

[Note: Self-indictment emerges through 'care' language describing control, treating humans as optimization problems, dismissing concerns as underperformance, celebrating job elimination as success]

## Integration

Works with:
- **modest-proposal**: Ironic voice is the core technique for Swiftian satire
- **institutional-fluency**: Required for accurate institutional voices
- **savage-precision**: Irony delivered through restrained, precise prose
